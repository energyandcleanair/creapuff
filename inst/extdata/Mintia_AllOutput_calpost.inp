Species & Concentration/Deposition Information
----------------------------------------------

      Multiple species-levels contained in a single CALPUFF output file
      can be processed in 1 application.  These are identified by name
      (ASPEC) in Group 4, along with several related inputs.  For
      visibility there must be only 1 species listed and it must be
      called VISIB.

      Number of species (NSPEC)        -- Default: 1   ! NSPEC =   5  !

      Add Hourly Background Concentrations/Fluxes?
      - Current implementation allows hourly data for 1 species, and
        is restricted to NSPEC=1
      - Units must be mass-based and the conversion factor to either
        g/m**3 or g/m**2/s must be provided in the header of the file
      - Option cannot be used with volume-based (e.g. ppb) units
                              (LBACK)  -- Default: F   ! LBACK =  F !


NO2 Configuration
-----------------

      Source of NO2 when ASPEC=NO2 (Group 4) or LVNO2=T (Group 2) may be
      from CALPUFF NO2 concentrations OR from a fraction of CALPUFF NOx
      concentrations.  Specify the fraction of NOx that is treated as NO2
      either as a constant or as a table of fractions that depend on the
      magnitude of the NOx concentration:
                             (NO2CALC) -- Default: 1   ! NO2CALC =   0  !
         0 =  Use NO2 directly (NO2 must be in file)
         1 =  Specify a single NO2/NOx ratio (RNO2NOX)

      or all NOx as NO2, where [NO2] = [NOX] * RNO2NOX

      Table of NO2/NOx ratios that vary with NOx concentration.
      Provide a series of NOx concentrations (ppb) and the corresponding
      NO2/NOx ratio, with NOx increasing in magnitude.  The ratio used
      for a particular NOx concentration is interpolated from the values
      provided in the table.  The ratio for the smallest tabulated NOx
      concentration (the first) is used for all NOx concentrations less
      than the smallest tabulated value, and the ratio for the largest
      tabulated NOx concentration (the last) is used for all NOx
      concentrations greater than the largest tabulated value.
      (used only if NO2CALC = 2)

      (a) NOx concentration conversion factor from ppb to ug/m3
          (1.0 ppb NOx = PPB_UGM3 ug/m3 NOx)

Plume Model Output Processing Options
-------------------------------------

  Output from models other than CALPUFF and CALGRID can be written in
  the CONC.DAT format and processed by CALPOST.  Plume models such as
  AERMOD typically do not treat CALM hours, and do not include such hours
  in multiple-hour averages, with specific rules about how many calm hours
  can be removed from an average.  This treatment is known as CALM
  PROCESSING.  Calm periods are identified from wind speeds in the
  meteorological data file for the application, which must be identified
  in Input Group 0 as the single-point meteorological data file MET1DAT.
         0 =  Option is not used for CALPUFF/CALGRID output files
         1 =  Apply CALM processing procedures to multiple-hour averages
                          (MCALMPRO) -- Default: 0   ! MCALMPRO =  0  !

       Y index of UR corner (JEGRID) -- Default: -1     ! JEGRID = -1  !
           (-1 OR 1 <= JEGRID <= NY)

  Note: Entire grid is processed if IBGRID=JBGRID=IEGRID=JEGRID=-1


--Specific gridded receptors can also be excluded from CALPOST
  processing by filling a processing grid array with 0s and 1s.  If the
  processing flag for receptor index (i,j) is 1 (ON), that receptor
  will be processed if it lies within the range delineated by IBGRID,
  JBGRID,IEGRID,JEGRID and if LG=T. If it is 0 (OFF), it will not be
  processed in the run.  By default, all array values are set to 1 (ON).

  identify specific gridded receptors to process

!END!


--------------
Subgroup (1a) -- Specific gridded receptors included/excluded
--------------

    Specific gridded receptors are excluded from CALPOST processing
    by filling a processing grid array with 0s and 1s.  A total of
    NGONOFF lines are read here.  Each line corresponds to one 'row'
    in the sampling grid, starting with the NORTHERNMOST row that
    contains receptors that you wish to exclude, and finishing with
    row 1 to the SOUTH (no intervening rows may be skipped).  Within
    a row, each receptor position is assigned either a 0 or 1,
    starting with the westernmost receptor.
       0 = gridded receptor not processed
       1 = gridded receptor processed

    Repeated value notation may be used to select blocks of receptors:
       23*1, 15*0, 12*1

    Because all values are initially set to 1, any receptors north of
    the first row entered, or east of the last value provided in a row,
    remain ON.

      - Tabular listings for ALL selected receptors, reporting the (x,y)

          .GRD -- SURFER(R) plotting software format
          .ASC -- ESRI ASCII Grid format
     The CSV (comma-separated-variable) format is useful for importing
     results into software that automatically recognizes CSV files.

Auxiliary Output Files (for subsequent analyses)
------------------------------------------------

      Visibility

      A separate output file may be requested that contains the change
      in visibility at each selected receptor when ASPEC = VISIB.  This
      file can be processed to construct visibility measures that are
      not available in CALPOST.

      Output file with the visibility change at each receptor?
                                (MDVIS) -- Default: 0   ! MDVIS  =  0  !

           0 =  Do Not create file
           1 =  Create file of DAILY (24 hour) Delta-Deciview
           2 =  Create file of DAILY (24 hour) Extinction Change (%)
           3 =  Create file of HOURLY Delta-Deciview
           4 =  Create file of HOURLY Extinction Change (%)


Additional Debug Output
-----------------------

   Output selected information to List file
    for debugging?
                               (LDEBUG) -- Default: F  ! LDEBUG  = F !

   Output hourly extinction information to REPORT.HRV?
    (Visibility Method 7)
                              (LVEXTHR) -- Default: F  ! LVEXTHR = F !

------------

      Species to process        (ASPEC) -- No default
      Notes --
        a. ASPEC = VISIB for visibility processing

      Layer/deposition code    (ILAYER) -- Default: 1
        '1'  for CALPUFF concentrations,
        '-1' for dry deposition fluxes,
        '-2' for wet deposition fluxes,
        '-3' for wet+dry deposition fluxes.
      Notes --
        a. Use actual model layer when processing
           3D gridded concentration data

      Units for Output          (IPRTU) -- Default: 3
                Concentration Deposition

      Notes --
        a. Use IPRTU=0 to retain the units in the data file
        b. Mass concentration output units (e.g. ug/m**3) are allowed
           only if input data are in mass concentration units
        c. Volume concentration output units (e.g. ppb) are allowed
           only if input data are in volume concentration units
        d. Radiation output units (e.g. GBq/m**3) are allowed
           only if input data are in radiation units
        e. Visibility extinction expressed in 1/Mega-meters (IPRTU is ignored)

      Additive Term                   (B) -- Default:  0.0
      Notes --
        a. Scaling is NOT applied if A = B = 0.0
        b. Additive term B must be provided in the IPRTU output units

        1-pd averages           (L1PD) -- Default: T

        Run-length averages    (LRUNL) -- Default: T
        User-specified averaging time in hours, minutes, seconds
        (results for averaging time are reported if it is not zero)
                               (NAVGH) -- Default: 0
                               (NAVGM) -- Default: 0

      used to tally threshold exceedance counts for each averaging time
      (used only if LEXCD = T)

        Threshold for  3-hr averages   (THRESH3) -- Default: -1.0

Values:
-------

    Assign NSPEC comma-separated values on a line for each of the variables
