Suggested naming conventions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TeTrZ__c1DXBdzNsmx3fmtxEDn-ZHxrGTVI4EbFMbvA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Contributing
There are two ways to proceed.
- work directly on `master` branch: usually not recommended, but given how early stage is the package, that can accelerate early fixes;
- create a branch, make modifications until you're fully satisfied, and then either submit a `pull request` or merge directly into `master`

If you are not very familiar with Git command line, I suggest installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
